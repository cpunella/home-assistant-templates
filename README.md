## Automations

### 🔒 Motion Detection Security System
**Location:** `automations/motion_sensors/`

A comprehensive Home Assistant automation that sends notifications when motion is detected while your alarm system is set to "away" mode.

**Features:**
- ✅ Multi-sensor support (Camera, PIR, Aqara occupancy sensors)
- ✅ Smart notifications with sensor location and timestamp  
- ✅ Optional security lighting activation
- ✅ Parallel processing for multiple simultaneous detections
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and high-priority alerts

### 🔋 Battery Monitoring System
**Location:** `automations/battery/`

Smart battery monitoring automation that tracks device battery levels and sends proactive notifications when batteries need replacement.

**Features:**
- ✅ Configurable battery level thresholds
- ✅ Device-specific notifications with battery percentage
- ✅ Smart filtering to avoid notification spam
- ✅ Support for all battery-powered Home Assistant devices

## Dashboards

### 📊 Motion Sensors Dashboard
**Location:** `dashboard/motion-sensors-dashboard/`

Comprehensive dashboard for monitoring motion detection across your home with real-time status and historical data visualization.

### 🔋 Battery Status Dashboard
**Location:** `dashboard/battery-status-dashboard/`

Centralized battery monitoring dashboard showing current battery levels, low battery alerts, and maintenance schedules for all battery-powered devices.

### 🌡️ Temperature Sensors Dashboard
**Location:** `dashboard/temperature-sensors-dashboard/`

Temperature monitoring dashboard with trend visualization, room-by-room temperature tracking, and climate control insights.

## Features
