## Automations

### ðŸ”’ Motion Detection Security System
**Location:** `automations/motion_sensors/`

A comprehensive Home Assistant automation that sends notifications when motion is detected while your alarm system is set to "away" mode.

**Features:**
- âœ… Multi-sensor support (Camera, PIR, Aqara occupancy sensors)
- âœ… Smart notifications with sensor location and timestamp  
- âœ… Optional security lighting activation
- âœ… Parallel processing for multiple simultaneous detections
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and high-priority alerts

**Setup:** Replace entity IDs with your sensors, configure alarm system condition, and set up notification service. See `automations/motion_sensors/README.md` for detailed instructions.

**Compatible with:** All motion sensor types, camera motion detection, Aqara occupancy sensors, any alarm system integration.

## Features

- **Security Automations**: Motion detection and alert systems for home security
- **Custom Dashboard Scripts**: Enhanced UI components for motion sensor monitoring
- **Template-Ready**: All automations sanitized and ready for public use
